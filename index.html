  <h1>Privacy Policy for "Transcript to Article" Chrome Extension</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated: March 2025</strong></p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Thank you for using the "Transcript to Article" Chrome extension ("the Extension"). This privacy policy explains how we handle user data when you use the Extension. Our goal is to be transparent about the data we collect, how we use it, and how we protect your privacy.</p>
  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>The Extension collects the following user data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OpenAI API Key</strong>: When you input your OpenAI API key in the Extension’s popup, it is stored locally in your browser using Chrome’s <code>chrome.storage</code> API. This key is used to make API calls to OpenAI for generating articles from YouTube transcripts.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>The OpenAI API key is used solely to authenticate and make requests to OpenAI’s API for the purpose of generating SEO-optimized blog articles from YouTube transcripts. The key is sent directly to OpenAI during API calls and is not stored or transmitted elsewhere by the Extension.</p>
  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The OpenAI API key is stored locally on your device using <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> (or <code>chrome.storage.local</code> if sync is disabled). This means the key may sync across your devices if Chrome Sync is enabled.</li>
    <li>We do not store, log, or transmit your API key to any third parties other than OpenAI for the purpose of API requests.</li>
    <li>The Extension does not collect or store any other personal data, such as your browsing history, YouTube video content, or generated articles, beyond what is temporarily processed during operation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OpenAI</strong>: The Extension uses OpenAI’s API to generate articles. When you provide an OpenAI API key, it is sent to OpenAI to authenticate API requests. Any transcript data extracted from YouTube is sent to OpenAI for processing. Please review <a href="https://openai.com/privacy/">OpenAI’s Privacy Policy</a> to understand how they handle your data.</li>
    <li><strong>YouTube</strong>: The Extension extracts transcripts from YouTube video pages (e.g., <code>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...</code>) if captions are enabled. This process occurs locally in your browser and does not involve storing or transmitting the transcript beyond the API call to OpenAI.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share your data with any third parties except as described above (OpenAI for API requests). The Extension does not collect or share personal information such as your name, email, or browsing history.</p>
  <h2>6. User Control</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can view, update, or remove your OpenAI API key at any time through the Extension’s popup interface.</li>
    <li>To remove the stored API key, you can clear the Extension’s storage via Chrome’s settings (<code>chrome://extensions/</code> > "Transcript to Article" > "Clear storage").</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>7. Cookies</h2>
  <p>The Extension does not use cookies.</p>
  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Extension’s functionality or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted at this URL, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised accordingly.</p>
  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or the Extension’s data practices, please contact us at [insert your email address, e.g., support@transcripttoarticle.com].</p>
